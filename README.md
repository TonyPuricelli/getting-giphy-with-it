# getting-giphy-with-it

This project accesses the Giphy API using AJAX and jQuery to display a dozen images related to a TV show (or any topic really) that can be selected by a button click or by form submission. Buttons and image displays are created using jQuery.

On user click, the images change state from still to looping and vice versa.

Bootstrap elements are combined with custom styles for display.
